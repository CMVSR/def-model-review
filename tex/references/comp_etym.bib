  abstract  = {Diachronic lexical information is not only important in the field of
               historical linguistics, but is also increasingly used in NLP, most recently
               for machine translation of low resource languages. Therefore, there is a need
               for fine-grained, large-coverage and accurate etymological lexical resources.
               In this paper, we propose a set of guidelines to generate such resources, for
               each step of the life-cycle of an etymological lexicon: creation, update,
               evaluation, dissemination, and exploitation. To illustrate the guidelines, we
               introduce EtymDB 2.0, an etymological database automatically generated from
               the Wiktionary, which contains 1.8 million lexemes, linked by more than
               700,000 fine-grained etymological relations, across 2,536 living and dead
               languages. We also introduce use cases for which EtymDB 2.0 could represent a
               key resource, such as phylogenetic tree generation, low resource machine
               translation or medieval languages study.},

               of the etymological information is only given in prose. We rely on custom

              languages exhibit extensive and diverse etymological relationships among
              lexical items. These relationships make the Turkic languages promising for
              exploring automated translation lexicon induction by leveraging cognate and
              other etymological information. However, due to the extent and diversity of
              the types of relationships between words, it is not clear how to annotate such
              information. In this paper, we present a methodology for annotating cognates
              and etymological origin in Turkic languages. Our method strives to balance the
              amount of research effort the annotator expends with the utility of the
