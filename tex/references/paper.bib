  abstract  = {Diachronic lexical information is not only important in the field of
               historical linguistics, but is also increasingly used in NLP, most recently
               for machine translation of low resource languages. Therefore, there is a need
               for fine-grained, large-coverage and accurate etymological lexical resources.
               In this paper, we propose a set of guidelines to generate such resources, for
               each step of the life-cycle of an etymological lexicon: creation, update,
               evaluation, dissemination, and exploitation. To illustrate the guidelines, we
               introduce EtymDB 2.0, an etymological database automatically generated from
               the Wiktionary, which contains 1.8 million lexemes, linked by more than
               700,000 fine-grained etymological relations, across 2,536 living and dead
               languages. We also introduce use cases for which EtymDB 2.0 could represent a
               key resource, such as phylogenetic tree generation, low resource machine
               translation or medieval languages study.},

              we look beyond engineering goals and analyze the relations between languages
              in computational representations. We introduce a methodology for comparing
              languages based on their organization of semantic concepts. We propose to
              conduct an adapted version of representational similarity analysis of a
              selected set of concepts in computational multilingual representations. Using
              this analysis method, we can reconstruct a phylogenetic tree that closely
              resembles those assumed by linguistic experts. These results indicate that
              multilingual distributional representations that are only trained on
              monolingual text and bilingual dictionaries preserve relations between
              languages without the need for any etymological information. In addition, we
              propose a measure to identify semantic drift between language families. We
              perform experiments on word-based and sentence-based multilingual models and
              provide both quantitative results and qualitative examples. Analyses of
              semantic drift in multilingual representations can serve two purposes: They
              can indicate unwanted characteristics of the computational models and they
              provide a quantitative means to study linguistic phenomena across languages.},

  abstract   = {Recently, generative approaches have
                been used effectively to
                provide definitions of words in their context. However, the
                opposite, i.e., generating a usage example given one or more
                words along with their definitions, has not yet been
                investigated. In this work, we introduce the novel task of
                Exemplification Modeling (ExMod), along with a
                sequence-to-sequence architecture and a training procedure for
                it. Starting from a set of (word, definition) pairs, our
                approach is capable of automatically generating high-quality
                sentences which express the requested semantics. As a result, we
                can drive the creation of sense-tagged data which cover the full
                range of meanings in any inventory of interest, and their
                interactions within sentences. Human annotators agree that the
                sentences generated are as fluent and semantically-coherent with
                the input definitions as the sentences in manually-annotated
                corpora. Indeed, when employed as training data for Word Sense
                Disambiguation, our examples enable the current state of the art
                to be outperformed, and higher results to be achieved than when
                using gold-standard datasets only. We release the pretrained
                model, the dataset and the software at
                https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/exmod.},
