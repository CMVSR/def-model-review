\section{Introduction}
Definitions are explicit representations of words or phrases that are valuable
for exposing the aspects of a given term. In general, definitions are
unambiguous and succint: they should be easy to read and understand. The
qualities of definitions that allow one to directly understand the meaning of a
word or phrase also allow the exploration of the semantic relationships between
words.

Word embeddings have been taken advantage of in order to obtain powerful
performance in a variety of NLP tasks. They are useful for capturing lexical
syntax and semantics based on word similarity. However, the interpretability of
word embeddings is limited.

Thus, the problem of definition modeling \cite{noraset_definition_2016} was
proposed to evaluate word embeddings. The task of definition modeling is to
generate a definition for a given term. The goal of a model trained on this task
is to train on word embedding and definition pairs in order to learn to generate
a definition for a given word or phrase.
