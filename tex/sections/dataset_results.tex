\section{Datasets and SOTA Results}

\textbf{GCIDE/WordNet:} The GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of
English (GCIDE) is a free dictionary supplemented with some defintions from
WordNet. Available under the GNU General Public License, GCIDE is a useful
corpus for dictionary definitions for general words. We provide dataset
statistics of GCIDE in Table \ref{tab:gcide_dataset_stats}. This dataset was
modified by \citeauthor*{noraset_definition_2016} for their original definition model
\cite{noraset_definition_2016}.

\textbf{Oxford Dictionary:} The Oxford Dictionary of English is a free
dictionary of English words and phrases. Collected by \citeauthor*{gadetsky_conditional_2018},
this dataset features contextual information for each word along with the
definition \cite{gadetsky_conditional_2018}. This dataset is useful for evaluating the ability of a model to
generate definitions for polysemous words. Dataset statistics are provided in
Table \ref{tab:oxford_dataset_stats}.

\textbf{Urban Dictionary:} The Urban Dictionary is a free dictionary of slang
words and phrases where definitions are crowdsourced by users. Proposed by
\citeauthor*{ni_learning_2017}, the Urban Dictionary dataset is useful for idioms and
rarely-used phrases which are not contained in other dictionary datasets
\cite{ni_learning_2017}. We provide dataset statistics of Urban Dictionary in Table
\ref{tab:urban_dataset_stats}.

\textbf{Wikpedia:} The English Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia. Proposed
by \citeauthor*{ishiwatari_learning_2019}, it combines the useful tasks of WordNet, Oxford
Dictionary, and Urban Dictionary, since it contains descriptions of many
concepts along with context to be used in context-aware models \cite{ishiwatari_learning_2019}. Statistics are
available in Table \ref{tab:wikipedia_dataset_stats}.
