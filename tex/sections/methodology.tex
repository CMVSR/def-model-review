\section{Methodologies Explored}
Methods -- ML, Deep Learning, Active Learning, Reinforcement learning, active learning etc.

\subsection{Machine Learning}
general overview diagram would be better.
\subsection{Deep Learning}
general diagram for deep learning approach.
\subsection{Transfer Learning}
overall diagram for transfer learning appraoch
\subsection{Methodology Comparisons}
Mostly focus on different group of papers focused on similar task with similar datasets. 
show tables that mentioned - dataset names, algorithm used (highlevel), performances (acc, f1 or so on). Need to think after writing those previous sections.
